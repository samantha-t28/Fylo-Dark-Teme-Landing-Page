# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page

![Design preview for the Fylo dark theme landing page challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to code the design as close as possible. I've choosen to use bootstrap for this project to get myself familiar with the framework.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
