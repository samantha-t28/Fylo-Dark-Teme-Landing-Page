# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

The design challenge is to code the design as close as possible. I've used css and bootstrap for this project to get myself familiar with the framework.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
